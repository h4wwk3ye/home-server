(IN ENGLISH) Don't worry,
that devil's afraid of us.

184
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,000
We're gonna take care of him.

185
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:05,417
And we're gonna put you
back where you belong.

Go ahead and run this for sequence period
and any hints of temporal aura.

189
00:14:30,292 --> 00:14:31,708
You know we won't get anything.

190
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:33,667
Yeah, just give it a shot.

192
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,958
HUNTER U-92: The branch
is nearing red line. We need to go.

193
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:40,375
Okay.

195
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:48,083
(IN ENGLISH) It's okay.

-(GAVEL BANGS)
-JUDGE: Next case, please.

200
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:19,458
Laufeyson. Variant L1130,
AKA Loki Laufeyson,

201
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:23,542
is charged with
sequence violation 7-20-89.

202
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,750
How do you plead?

203
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:29,458
(CHUCKLES)

204
00:15:29,542 --> 00:15:32,000
Madam, a god doesn't plead.

205
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:36,458
This has been a very enjoyable pantomime,
but I'd like to go home now.

206
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,750
Are you guilty or not guilty, sir?

207
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:43,458
(SCOFFS) Guilty of being
the God of Mischief? Yes.

208
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:46,625
Guilty of finding
all this incredibly tedious? Yes.

209
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:51,083
Guilty of a crime
against the Sacred Timeline?

210
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,500
Absolutely not, you have the wrong person.

211
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,625
Oh, really? And who should we have?

212
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,833
I suspect, the Avengers.

213
00:15:57,917 --> 00:16:01,625
I came into possession of the Tesseract
because they traveled through time,

214
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:06,208
no doubt in a last-ditch effort
to stave off my ascent to God King.

215
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:08,333
That's quite an accusation.

216
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:11,625
LOKI: Oh, believe me, you can smell
the cologne of two Tony Starks.

217
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:15,375
You speak of Time Criminals?
It's they you should be after.

218
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:19,750
Perhaps you could provide me
with a taskforce and resources,

219
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,417
and I could return
and eliminate them for you.

220
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,333
We're not here to talk about the Avengers.

221
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:25,583
-Oh, no?
-No.

222
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:29,625
What they did was supposed to happen.
You escaping was not.

223
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:32,958
(LAUGHS)

224
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:35,667
Right. Uh...

225
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,042
"Not supposed to happen"?
According to whom?

226
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:41,333
The Time-Keepers?

227
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,333
Oh, the Time-Keepers. Right.

228
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:49,083
Well, perhaps I should speak
to these Time-Keepers, gods to gods.

229
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:52,125
I'm sorry, but they're quite busy.

230
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,083
Oh, they are? What are they doing?

231
00:16:54,167 --> 00:16:56,042
Dictating the proper flow of time.

232
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,792
I see. Right. And then what do you do?

233
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,208
Dictate the proper flow of time
according to their dictations.

234
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:03,417
How do you plead?

235
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,417
Guilty...

236
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,333
of this.

-Don't rush me. (GRUNTS)

241
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,500
Damn it! Why won't it work?

242
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:34,125
Magic powers?
They're no good in the TVA, Mr. Laufeyson.

243
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,875
The court finds you guilty,
and I sentence you to be reset.

244
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,458
Next case, please!

245
00:17:39,542 --> 00:17:43,500
"Reset"? What does that mean?
What, is it bad? What does it mean?

246
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:48,083
Hey! You ridiculous bureaucrats
will not dictate how my story ends!

247
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:51,542
It's not your story, Mr. Laufeyson.
It never was.

248
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:54,542
You have no idea what I'm capable of!

249
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,208
MAN: I... I think I might.

250
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,333
Have an idea of what he's capable of.

251
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,125
Approach the bench.

252
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:09,167
(SOFTLY) Hi.

253
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,458
If you're thinking what I think you are,
it's a bad idea.

254
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:15,750
Okay, I'm just chasing a hunch.

255
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:20,333
Anything goes sideways, it's on you.

256
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:23,333
Okay. I feel like
I'm always looking up to you.

257
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:25,708
I like it. It's appropriate.

259
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:36,333
And who are you?

260
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:43,083
I'm gonna burn this place to the ground.

261
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:46,042
I'll show you where my desk is,
you can start there.

262
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,292
Have a look.

Home sweet home.

264
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,708
I thought there was no magic here.

265
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:06,833
There isn't.

266

That's not real.

00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:34,250
It is, and, unfortunately,
so is all the paperwork.

Good tinder for your fire, though.
Come on.

269
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,708
This place is a nightmare.

270
00:19:38,792 --> 00:19:40,042
That's another department.

271
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,292
Now that department
I'll help you burn down.

No. That's where you just were.

I don't like to talk.

But you do like to lie,
which you just did.

278
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,625
Because we both know you love to talk.

279
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,167

280
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,333
How long have you been here?

281
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:16,667
(SIGHS) I don't know. It's hard to say,
time passes differently here in the TVA.

-You'll catch up.

Yes.

For the record, this really does feel
like a killing-me kind of a room.

Not big on trust, are you?

Maybe I'd like to learn.

You answer them honestly,
